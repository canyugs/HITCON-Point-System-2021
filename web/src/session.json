Based on the major mistakes made by Japan's leading companies, 7-Eleven, Docomo (Japan's largest cell phone), and Japan Post Bank (Japan's fourth largest bank and a former state-owned company), I’ll explore the deeper causes that led to these incidents. In all three cases, two major mistakes were made; if they had been dealt with properly the first time, less damage would have been done.\nThe payment systems in Taiwan and Japan are very similar, so there should be great lessons to be learned."

                "description": "As the Covid-19 spreads around the world, attackers are exploiting Covid-19 to launch various cyber-attacks. The delivery of spam emails with malware and attacks targeting vulnerabilities in specific VPN devices have increased. As peopleʼs lives, especially work styles, shifted to work from home, the targets of attackers also changed. In this presentation, we will show you how the Covid-19 has a greater impact on overall security landscape compared to other threats.\n\nIt was found that the number of attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in SSL-VPN devices increased sharply in 2020 compared to 2019 before Covid-19. We will explain the vulnerabilities of each device and the attack method by using ransomware in detail. About 25% of all ransomware victims were caused by VPN devices.\n\nSince March 2020, spam emails related Covid-19 that have been continuously confirmed around the world. Attackers put keywords such as masks, financial aid, and vaccines in the body of the email to make people open the email. We will introduce that how attackers are taking advantage of peopleʼs psychological states. In addition, we found that the adversary had something in common in their spam emails and malware that helps further categorizing processes.\n\nLearning from past incidents is important for finding sophisticated threats. However, in most cases, detailed information on past incidents is not disclosed. Therefore, we will explain that how to find threats from cases of traces recorded by the attackerʼs TTPs and malware behavior."

                "description": "Not so long ago a good friend of mine complained about a strange phenomenon - since the installation of his newly advanced intercom, he started to receive some weird phone calls in the middle of night. On top of this, when he answers these strange calls, the associated intercom mobile application in his smartphone is opened and he sees the interior of random offices around the world. Intrigued, I started to investigate further in order to find out what is going on..\n\nIn this talk, I will take you through my adventure to understand what happened that night and how I completed the research with a PWN of the entire intercom system. I will explain how modern intercoms are working, what kind of new features they hold, and how I was able to PWN a popular intercom brand (V-TEC) and bypass their security features to get remote access to the video feed (camera) and door control (lock) of ALL the cloud connected V-TEC intercoms worldwide.\n\nThrough the talk I will also elaborate on all the involved technologies and protocols related to VOIP - the delivery of voice communications and multimedia sessions over the internet. This includes SIP, SDP, STUN, and RTP to name a few.\n\nI will start my presentation with a brief introduction to intercoms including the technology behind them and the history of their development from the early 1900’s up to the current version with modern features such as cloud connectivity, video stream, PPT, and more. Next I will discuss how I started this research using OSINT such as online research and RTFM. After that I will explain how I obtained the firmware and reverse engineering it to discover serious security flaws in the cloud connectivity features. \n\nThe vulnerabilities I discovered allowed me to write an exploit that bypasses the authentication mechanism of all cloud-connected V-TEC intercoms. This enabled me to take remote control on the intercoms including opening the door, watching the intercom’s live video stream, playing audio (PPT) and more. \n\nFinally, I will introduce an automation I built using all the information I gathered through my research. The automation remotely connects to random V-TEC intercoms around the world, obtains a video feed of 20-25 seconds and stores it as a .mp4 file on my hard drive with the associated IP address and country of where the device is located."

This presentation first organizes  the Lazarus group's attack campaigns and shows the possible links between the attack operations in this research and public information released from security vendors. Then, we introduce the latest TTPs, including malware and tools used in the following two campaigns by Lazarus group, which  our IR team investigated.\n\n* Operation Dream Job\n* Operation JTrack\n\nOperation Dream Job is a campaign targeting the defense industry, and its attacks have been confirmed in various parts of the world. There are many types of malware used in this campaign, and we describe them in detail. In addition, we describe the tools used by attackers in the network and TTP in ATT&CK. Operation JTrack was an attack campaign that targeted the organizations in Japan. Some types of malware and tools are also used in this campaign, which are described in detail. We present tools that can be used to analyze these malware. Finally, we compare the TTPs of these two attack campaigns and provide information that can be used for defense.\nThis presentation helps you understand the Lazarus group's latest TTPs and can be used for IR and defense."

Needless to say, vulnerabilities in Exchange have long been the Holy Grail for attackers, hence our security research on Exchange. Surprisingly, we've found not only critical vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, but a whole new attack surface of Exchange.\n\nThis new attack surface is based on a significant change in Exchange Server 2013, where the fundamental protocol handler, Client Access Service (CAS), splits into frontend and backend. In this fundamental change of architecture, quite an amount of design debt was incurred, and, even worse, it introduced inconsistencies between contexts, leading us to discover this new attack surface.\n\nTo unveil the beauty of this attack surface and our novel exploitation, we'll start by analyzing this architecture, followed by 8 vulnerabilities that consist of server-side bugs, client-side bugs, and crypto bugs found via this attack surface. In the end, these vulnerabilities are chained into 4 attack vectors that shine in different attack scenarios: ProxyLogon, ProxyShell, ProxyOracle and ProxyRelay. These attack vectors enable any unauthenticated attacker to uncover plaintext passwords and even execute arbitrary code on Microsoft Exchange Servers through port 443, which is exposed to the Internet by ~400K Exchange Servers.\n\nThis attack surface has its unparalleled impact for a reason: security researchers tend to find vulnerabilities from a certain perspective, such as digging for memory bugs, injections, or logic flaws, but we took a different approach by looking at Exchange from a high-level architectural view and captured this architecture-level attack surface, which yielded multiple vulnerabilities. We hope this brings a new paradigm to vulnerability research and inspires more security researchers to look into Exchange Server. Last but not least, we'll provide hardening actions to mitigate such types of 0days in Exchange."

In early January 2021, a Chinese APT actor was taking aim at organizations running Microsoft Exchange with a critical zero-day exploit that allowed them to download e-mails at will. As bad that sounds, it was actually just the beginning. The initial flaw would soon be combined with other zero-day exploits to allow full remote code execution on Exchange servers around world. This talk will review Volexity’s initial discovery of the main vulnerability that allowed these events to happen, and the actions of the threat actor known as Hafnium. It will cover the initial stealthy activities of the group; the later targeted exploitation and lateral movement; and the resulting widespread exploitation that compromised tens of thousands of servers around the world."

Among these organizations, Mitsubishi Electric ranks among the most prolific. Because the operation of this ecosystem is so widely used in key manufacturing, natural gas supply, oil, water, aviation, railways, chemicals, food and beverages, and construction, it is closely-related to people's lives. For this reason, the security of this ecosystem is extraordinarily important.\n\nThis research will enter the Mitsubishi ecosystem’s communication protocol, using it as a lens with which to deeply explore the differences between itself and other ecosystems. We will show how we successfully uncovered flaws in its identity authentication function, including how to take it over and show that such an attack can cause physical damage in different critical sectors. We’ll explain how we accomplished this by applying reverse engineering and communication analysis. This flaw allows attackers to take over any asset within the entire series of Mitsubishi PLCs, allowing command of the ecosystem and full control of the relevant sensors. A further complication is that making a fix to the various communication protocols in the ICS/SCADA is extremely difficult.

There are two new pieces of listening port malware, RBRAT and a Stone variant. We also found a shellcode-based backdoor, Natwalk, and the method it used to call the Windows API was also innovative, making the reversing more difficult.\nThe group is also more careful in their usage of C2. They use DNS tunnelling extensively as well as Cloudflare Worker to hide their real C2 IP.\n\nWe have observed that Winnti targeted telecommunications companies, key medical institutions, governments, and major infrastructures in various countries in 2021.\nThe prosecution did not deter them, but instead prompted them to evolve their attack techniques, and make it harder for researchers to track and detect.\n\nIn this talk we will provide more details about the campaigns of  Winnti , including its innovative TTPs, newly developed malware, lateral movement techniques, and the strategies they used for C2 after they were sued by the FBI."
