                "description": "A Million Boluses: Discovery and Disclosure of Vulnerabilities in an\r\nInsulin Pump\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nHacking medical devices and cybersecurity in public health is the\r\nsubject of recent discussions [1]. The Federal Office for Information\r\nSecurity (BSI) aims to improve transparent communication regarding\r\ncybersecurity risks of networked medical devices [2]. To this end, the\r\nBSI initiated the project ManiMed – Manipulation of Medical Devices to\r\nfacilitate a trustful communication and cooperation between\r\nmanufacturers, security researchers, and authorities. This study targets\r\nthe current cybersecurity state of smart and connected medical devices\r\n[3,4] and illustrates what kind of questions the medical device industry\r\nis facing by making their devices smart.\r\nThis article focuses on security vulnerabilities identified in the DANA\r\nDiabecare RS insulin pump to illustrate what kind of questions the\r\nmedical device industry faces by making their devices smart. The\r\nexemplifying vulnerabilities affected the pump's proprietary, Bluetooth\r\nLow Energy (BLE)-based communication and affected patient safety.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nThe assessment of medical devices is highly specialized and individual\r\nin terms of the device's medical use case, present interfaces, used\r\ntechnologies and assumptions to its environment [5]. The device was\r\nassessed following a black-box approach. The proprietary communication\r\nprotocol built on top of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) was\r\nreverse-engineered using the manufacturer's Android and iOS applications\r\nand captures of the communication between the pump and its mobile apps\r\nusing elementary BLE prototyping hardware. In the scope of the\r\nassessment were applied cryptography, Man-in-the-Middle attacks,\r\neavesdropping of the communication, as well as the authentication and\r\npairing process.\r\nA coordinated vulnerability disclosure process (CVD) was initiated to\r\nkeep the smart medical device on the market while ensuring that it no\r\nlonger poses a threat to patient safety. The disclosure deadline was set\r\nwith the constraint that measures must not harm the therapeutic purpose\r\nof the medical device. The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical\r\nDevices (BfArM), as the national authority for vigilance in Germany, was\r\nnotified and involved.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nDuring the security assessment, client-side controls, weak generation of\r\nencryption keys, improper verification of the pump's identity, missing\r\nreplay protection, the insecure transmission of cryptographic keys, and\r\nan overall weak authentication mechanism were identified. By hijacking\r\nthe pump, an attacker can administer insulin boluses remotely, causing\r\nsevere patient harm [6].\r\nThe coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) process was extended and\r\nlasted several months until a patch was rolled out to patients with a\r\nnew pump firmware and major mobile application upgrades.

                "description": "A Million Boluses: Discovery and Disclosure of Vulnerabilities in an\r\nInsulin Pump\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n\r\nHacking medical devices and cybersecurity in public health is the\r\nsubject of recent discussions [1]. The Federal Office for Information\r\nSecurity (BSI) aims to improve transparent communication regarding\r\ncybersecurity risks of networked medical devices [2]. To this end, the\r\nBSI initiated the project ManiMed – Manipulation of Medical Devices to\r\nfacilitate a trustful communication and cooperation between\r\nmanufacturers, security researchers, and authorities. This study targets\r\nthe current cybersecurity state of smart and connected medical devices\r\n[3,4] and illustrates what kind of questions the medical device industry\r\nis facing by making their devices smart.\r\nThis article focuses on security vulnerabilities identified in the DANA\r\nDiabecare RS insulin pump to illustrate what kind of questions the\r\nmedical device industry faces by making their devices smart. The\r\nexemplifying vulnerabilities affected the pump's proprietary, Bluetooth\r\nLow Energy (BLE)-based communication and affected patient safety.\r\n\r\nMethods\r\n\r\nThe assessment of medical devices is highly specialized and individual\r\nin terms of the device's medical use case, present interfaces, used\r\ntechnologies and assumptions to its environment [5]. The device was\r\nassessed following a black-box approach. The proprietary communication\r\nprotocol built on top of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) was\r\nreverse-engineered using the manufacturer's Android and iOS applications\r\nand captures of the communication between the pump and its mobile apps\r\nusing elementary BLE prototyping hardware. In the scope of the\r\nassessment were applied cryptography, Man-in-the-Middle attacks,\r\neavesdropping of the communication, as well as the authentication and\r\npairing process.\r\nA coordinated vulnerability disclosure process (CVD) was initiated to\r\nkeep the smart medical device on the market while ensuring that it no\r\nlonger poses a threat to patient safety. The disclosure deadline was set\r\nwith the constraint that measures must not harm the therapeutic purpose\r\nof the medical device. The Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical\r\nDevices (BfArM), as the national authority for vigilance in Germany, was\r\nnotified and involved.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nDuring the security assessment, client-side controls, weak generation of\r\nencryption keys, improper verification of the pump's identity, missing\r\nreplay protection, the insecure transmission of cryptographic keys, and\r\nan overall weak authentication mechanism were identified. By hijacking\r\nthe pump, an attacker can administer insulin boluses remotely, causing\r\nsevere patient harm [6].\r\nThe coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) process was extended and\r\nlasted several months until a patch was rolled out to patients with a\r\nnew pump firmware and major mobile application upgrades. The\r\nmanufacturer released security advisories in the forms of a Field Safety\r\nNotice (FSN)\r\n[7]. A Medical Advisory (ICSMA) as well as CVEs were published by the\r\nCybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [8].\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThis example demonstrates that mature processes for handling\r\ncybersecurity vulnerabilities with safety impact on active medical\r\ndevices are not yet common among all medical device manufacturers, even\r\nthough recognized procedures [9, 10] based on pervasive community\r\nknowledge are in place.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n[1] Newman L.

                "description": "This presentation provides an analysis of the advanced persistent threat (APT) attacks that have occurred during the past two years on the semiconductor industry. Our research shows that the majority of these attacks were concentrated on the Taiwan semiconductor sector. This is worthy of concern, as Taiwan's semiconductor industry plays a very crucial role in the world. Even a small disruption in the supply chain could have a serious ripple effect throughout the entire industry. Surprisingly, up until now, there has been less coverage on these attacks. In this presentation, we seek to shed light on the threat actors and campaigns of these attacks, where they are collectively referred to as Operation Chimera (a.k.a. Skeleton). Additionally, we provide a brief overview of the current information security status of Taiwan's semiconductor industry.\n\nBetween 2018 and 2019, we discovered several attacks on various semiconductor vendors located at the Hsinchu Science-based Industrial Park in Taiwan. As these attacks employed similar attack techniques and tactics, a pattern could be discerned from the malicious activities. From this pattern, we deduced that these attacks, which we dubbed Operation Chimera, were actually conducted by the same threat actor. The main objective of these attacks appeared to be stealing intelligence, specifically documents about IC chips, software development kits (SDKs), IC designs, the source code, etc. If such documents are successfully stolen, the impact can be devastating. The motive behind these attacks likely stems from competitors or even countries seeking to gain a competitive advantage over rivals. Since the similar techniques and tactics to previous attack activities, we suspect the attacker is China-based hacker group. We thus hope that this presentation will help semiconductor companies gain a better understanding of the dangers from such attacks. Additionally, as we have worked with several of the semiconductor vendors to improve their cyber security, we wish to share this valuable experience, and highlight the current challenges facing the entire industry.\n\nIn this presentation, we conduct a comprehensive analysis on the employed technologies, tactics, and customized malware of Operation Chimera. As this operation has not yet been documented, the techniques and tactics disclosed in this presentation can help blue teams design better defenses, and develop better detection and hunting methods. Below summarizes our findings of Operation Chimera.\n\nA unique account manipulation malware - SkeletonKeyInjector – was used. SkeletonKeyInjector contained code extracted from Dumpert and Mimikatz. This malware implanted a skeleton key into domain controller (DC) servers to continuously conduct lateral movement (LM). Additionally, by making direct syscalls, the malware could bypass security products based on API hooking. This malware was discovered in the two cases mentioned in this presentation.\nThe threat actor utilized Cobalt Strike as their main remote-access Trojan (RAT). The mutated Cobalt Strike backdoor replaced and masqueraded as Google Update to confuse users. Additionally, as most corresponding (command and control) C2s were located in the Google Cloud Platform, it made it difficult to attribute the actor. Aside from the two cases mentioned in this presentation, we also detected the presence of this malware in other semiconductor vendors.\nChimera used an old and patched version of RAR for data exfiltration. The same binary was found in the two cases mentioned in this presentation."

Sadly, the House of Force is shut down by new runtime checks in glibc version 2.28. But the House of Force isn't out of business yet: Ubuntu 18.04 LTS is one of the most widely used Linux distributions, and it ships with glibc 2.27.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I explain how to chain several glibc heap exploitation techniques to implement a reliable RCE exploit for a heap buffer overflow (CVE-2020-12861) that I found in SANE, which is used by Ubuntu’s Simple Scan application (and also LibreOffice) to connect to scanners on the local network. The main difficulty is how to defeat ASLR remotely. Almost all the steps of the exploit chain are about manufacturing a remote infoleak, which enables me to defeat ASLR reliably. In a key step, I use a variation on the House of Force to compute a subtraction, which enables me to forge a stack pointer. I also use a new technique called “fastbin reverse into tcache” to write a large value to the stack.\r\n\r\nThe talk is primarily about glibc heap exploitation techniques. The vulnerability in SANE is the motivating example, but the details of the vulnerability are not the main focus of the talk. I demo several of the techniques that I use for the SANE exploit, including the House of Force and “fastbin reverse into tcache”.\r"

                "description": "VMware workstation is a popular personal virtualization software that has been frequently targeted by major cracking events since many years. In September 2019, our team discovered an interesting heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the VMware workstation's virtual NIC device e1000e. The vulnerability was caused by the e1000e virtual NIC's failure to meticulously inspect a field used during packet grouping. However, due to code limitations, the vulnerability can only perform a high-low byte-converted subtraction operation on a certain word memory within a limited out-of-bounds range. Through a lot of attempts we eventually succeeded in using the vulnerability to escape the then latest version of VMware workstation virtual machine. This topic will specifically introduce the causes of the vulnerability and our ideas on how to exploit the vulnerability.\nIn this issue, we will first briefly introduce the software architecture of VMware workstation and the related components in recent years' cracking attacks; then we will introduce in detail the common structures and exploitations related to VMware workstation escape in recent years; after that, we will analyze the vulnerability of the virtual NIC device. causes, and what the vulnerability can achieve; then we will detail our various exploit attempts against the vulnerability and the ideas and methods we used to finally successfully exploit the vulnerability; and finally we will briefly summarize some of the interesting changes in the new version of VMware workstation and show a video of us finally achieving a complete escape."

During the booting process, Samsung uses S-boot (Secure Boot) to make sure it can only boot a stocked image. If the device tries to boot a custom image, it will trip a one-time programmable bit e-fuse (a.k.a Knox bit). Once a trustzone app (trustlet) detects the Knox bit tripped, it will delete the encryption key for the sensitive data to prevent unauthorized data access to the locked phone.\r\nIn this presentation, we'll present several vulnerabilities we found in S-Boot that are related to USB request handling. By exploiting these vulnerabilities, we're allowed to bypass the mitigation of S-boot through the USB device and obtain code execution in early boot stage. In other words, as long as we have the phone (whether locked or not) and an USB-C connector, we'll be able to boot a custom image without tripping the Knox bit, allowing us to retrieve sensitive data from a locked device.\r\nWe will also describe how we discover and exploit the vulnerabilities in detail, demonstrate the exploit on a Samsung Galaxy S10 smartphone, and discuss the possible impact of these vulnerabilities."

                "description": "Development of Flexible Signaling Spoofing Attacks Using Function Containerization of Rogue Base Station\r\nBy applying Software-Defined Radio (SDR) technology, attackers could easily establish rogue Base Stations (BSs) to launch signaling spoofing, denial-of-service (DoS), or even Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks in 4G LTE or 5G NR networks. However, the antenna capability of the rogue BSs limits the attack range and the effective results, and determines the possibility of being detected. In this proposal, we leverage a lightweight virtualization innovation, docker, to enable the containerization of radio access networks (RANs) and core networks (CNs) of rogue BSs, thereby realizing a large-scale signaling spoofing attack. In particular, we focus on the forgery of the signaling information blocks (SIBs), which is regarded as an essential broadcasting messages carrying fundamental instructions for a normal operation in 4G LTE networks.\r\n\r\nIn the proposed attacks, the victim will receive fake emergency alerts for panics or scam spreading, manipulated GPS information for wrong time synchronization, malicious black-list for disconnection, or fallacious power control message for battery depletion. Furthermore, we introduce Kubernetes to manage the developed attacks in the containers and to launch a cooperative attack in different geographic locations. We will demonstrate the proposed attack and show the negative effects it caused to the public.\r\n\r\nSince the SIBs will be exploited to deliver operational information in 5G NR, the proposed SIB spoofing attacks could be easily implemented and realized, which of course will introduce severe damage to the 5G applications such as IoT. We also discuss the possible detection and protection approaches for the proposed SIB spoofing attack in 5G networks.\r"

Well, it would be scary to know that the hospitality industry is a prime board nowadays for cyber threats as hotels offer many opportunities for hackers and other cybercriminals to target them and therefore resulting in data breaches. Not just important credit card details are a prime reason, but also an overload of guest data, including emails, passport details, home addresses and more. Marriot International where 500 million guests' private information was compromised sets for one of the best examples. Besides data compromise, surgical strikes have been conducted by threat actors against targeted guests at luxury hotels in Asia and the United States. The advanced persistent threat campaign called Darkhotel infected wifi-networks at luxury hotels, prompted the victim to download the malware and thus, succeeded in specifically targeting traveling business executives in a variety of industries and all its prevalence seems to have no end yet.\r\n\r\nFor a broader look, this time a popular internet gateway device for visitor based networks commonly installed in hotels, malls and other places that provides guests temporary access to Wi-Fi was examined. To see, how the guests and the hotels both have a serious stake in this, we will discourse about the working of guest Wi-Fi systems, different use cases and their attack surfaces: device exploitation, network traffic hi-jacking, accessing guest's details and more. Common attacks and their corresponding defenses will be discussed. This talk will contain demos of attacks to reveal how the remote exploitation of such a device puts millions of guests at risk."
